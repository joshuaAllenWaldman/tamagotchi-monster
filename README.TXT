Welcome to "Digital Monster Caretaker Simulator"! This experience was designed by Joshua Allen Waldman in the year of our Lord, 2020.

Waldman created this experience as a way to deter those who came in contact with from purchasing Monsters all willy nilly. The hope was that through the experience potential Monster buyers would come to understand the great responsibility that came with ownership of a Monster. Between feeding, playing with, and forcing the Monster to sleep there's much to contend with inorder to keep the Monster happy and healthy. Waldman believed that most people would not want to deal with such responsibility and would give pu on the notion of owning a Monster after going through the experience. Only time will tell if he was correct in his assumption.

"Digital Monster Caretaker Simulator" was created using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

 1. Give your Monster a good American Name(Other names are allowed but not recommended).
 2. Start the Game
 3. Monsters are very needy and require constant maintanence. Use the Feed, Play, and Sleep buttons to keep the Monster's Hunger, Boredom, and Tiredness meter bars from filling up. Once one of them fills up you can basically kiss your Monster goodbye forever because it is now dead.
 4. Track how long you can keep your Monster alive by recording the highest age you can reach. (Note, Monster's age differently than humans. 1 Monster year is equal to 10,000 of our Human miliseconds.)
5. If you're monster dies that is it. You lose. However, if for some reason you enjoy the experience you can start over from Game OVer screen to try again with the same monster or you can  refresh the page to pick a better name. 


Thank you for playing and please do not purchase a Monster in real life.
